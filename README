*Abstract*

In radiation oncology, patients experience a certain waiting time between their initial CT-Scan and the start of their treatment. Although highly structured and procedural, because of the number of departments and people involved in the 8 steps between the two, the waiting time can vary from a few days to many weeks. In this paper, we use a tool set of unique and exhaustive data filtering, distinct data visualizations, and a survey of algorithms expand upon the accuracy and efficacy of waiting time prediction. Patient records from the Montreal General Hospital are used with a combination of modern computing and frameworks to present and explore the data. With 9 visualizations presented in this paper, both patients and doctors are targeted. With the patient-oriented graphs, a more clear breakdown of each stage shows the context of the stage within the total waiting time. The doctor-driven charts help to identify problems with data and to increase efficiency. As a result of the filtering, fewer assumptions needed to be made with the data, resulting in more exhaustive and comprehensive data used in the training for the 5 predictions algorithms compared. Finally, a Gaussian Process algorithm gave a predictive waiting time accurate to 9.08 days. By combining results in this paper with more data and specific factors in the data trends, future would could lead towards a better estimate. Using other combinations of visualizations, future work also lead towards substantially more uniform treatment by different oncologists.
